The collaborative research project described in the [syllabus]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/syllabus) took place in the second half of the semester. Students decided on the topic of U.S.-Mexico Border Relations. Featured below is a list of final student-written summaries of their experiences with the project.

U.S.-Mexico Border Relations
----------------------------

By now you've studied many aspects of recent Mexican migration to the United States: cultural, political, economic, and geographical. Step back, think it all over, and write a one-page memo of your thoughts that you'd like to pass on to future students who take this class, or to the world at large. What can we understand better from the time you've taken to examine this issue? What questions still remain?

It doesn't have to be long at all, but take the time to polish it. Imagine yourself talking to a broad educated public.
